# DNSTWIST module

This project uses a modified (by me) snapshot of dnstwist, in
dnstwister/dnstwist. The snapshot of dnstwist was added to my project in
[this commit](https://github.com/thisismyrobot/dnstwister/commit/7ca44e96cb3b394d3e85fdb07b20e679e76e0742).

I have left the dnstwist original README and LICENCE in this snapshot, I hope
this is correct attribution and a correct use of the dnstwist project within
my project.

I am also using the identical Apache 2.0 license on my project, as I am unsure
how any other license would interact.

If you come across this repository and disagree with my usage, please contact
me via robert @ this is my robot . com and I will rectify it as quickly as
possible.
