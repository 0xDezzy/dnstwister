A Heroku-hosted version of the very excellent
[dnstwist](https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist).

Hosted [here](https://dnstwister.report).

## DNSTWIST module

This project uses a modified (by me) snapshot of version 1.02 of dnstwist, in
dnstwister/dnstwist.

I have left the dnstwist original README and LICENCE in this snapshot, I hope
this is correct attribution and a correct use of the dnstwist project within
my project.

I have applied an "Unlicense" to DNS Twister and I believe
[this is acceptable](http://opensource.stackexchange.com/a/963/3236). If you
come across this repository and disagree with my usage, attribution or
licensing of dnstwist, please raise a Git issue and I will address your
concern as quickly as possible.

## Tests

WIP, run using 'py.test'.

## Google App Engine

This project used to be on GAE but has since been migrated to Heroku. To view
the GAE codebase you'll need to look at the [1.1
tag](https://github.com/thisismyrobot/dnstwister/releases/tag/1.1).
