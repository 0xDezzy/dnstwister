        <p>

            <a href="https://github.com/thisismyrobot/dnstwister/commits/heroku-deploy/dnstwister/static/privacy.html" target="_blank">Last updated 23/11/2017</a>

        <h2>The personal information we collect</h2>

        <h3>Email addresses and domain names</h3>
        <p>

            When you subscribe to receive email alerts for a domain, we
            store a mapping between your email address and that domain.

        </p>
        <p>

            When an atom feed is requested for a domain, that domain is
            recorded to allow us to generate the feed with new, updated or
            deleted resolvable domain names.

        </p>
        <p>

            We categorise both the email address and domain name as "personal
            information" as either may be - for instance
            "john.doe@example.com" or "www.john-doe-blog.com". Obviously
            anyone can request information about a particular domain.

        </p>

        <h3>Logs</h3>
        <p>

            The logs generated by the <strong>dnstwister</strong> web
            application are archived in Papertrail. They will only be reviewed
            by the developer to troubleshoot production-site issues. These
            logs will never be shared with any other party.

        </p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>

            <strong>dnstwister</strong> does not set cookies, although one or
            more of the third-party services mentioned below may.

        </p>

        <h2>How we store your personal information</h2>
        <p>

            Your personal information is stored with a third-party, Heroku,
            along with all other information used to operate
            <strong>dnstwister</strong>.

        <h2>How we use your personal information</h2>

            <strong>dnstwister</strong>.

        </p>
        <p>

            If you unsubscribe from receiving email alerts for a domain, we
            permanently delete this mapping. If there are no requests for the
            Atom feed for a domain for three days then that domain's
            information is also permanently deleted.

        </p>

        <h2>Law enforcement</h2>
        <p>

            It is possible that we may be required by court order to provide
            information about our customers to third parties. We may also be
            required to provide information pursuant to law, applicable
            regulation, subpoena or other legal process. It is our policy to
            ensure adherence to the due process of law in all such legal
            requests. If we are required to provide information under these
            circumstances, we will, whenever possible, attempt to inform users
